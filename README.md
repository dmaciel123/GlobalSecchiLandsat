# Global Secchi Landsat
 
This code applies the Mixture Density Network (MDN) algorithm to Landsat atmospherically corrected or in situ measured Remote Sensing Reflectance to predict Secchi Disk Depth (Zsd). 

To run the code, clone the GitHub repository and install the required packages (environment.txt) in a new Python (3.6 or 3.9) environment. 

Two examples are provided:

1) Running the MDN for TM, ETM+, and OLI simulated Rrs based on a subset of GLORIA (Lehmann et al. 2023) dataset

2) Running the MDN for OLI-2 Chesapeake Bay Rrs data for spatialize the Zsd.
